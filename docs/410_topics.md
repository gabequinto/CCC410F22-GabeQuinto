### TOPIC IDEAS

* The first topic idea that I have is to explore physical security tokens. This will include the functions behind them, the security benifits/risks, and the protocols that
that are used. While doing this I will also try to find a method for Cyber.local admins to secure virtual machines with a physical token. 
* My second topic idea would be a pre-selected project that one of the professors at Champlain College has as an option. However for this I still need to speak with the 
professors to confirm this.
