### Physical Security Tokens
------
A physical security token is a physical devices that is used to secure a device. When logging into a device a person must have the physical token to be able to login. This is a way of 
providing 2FA. 

Why?
------
Physical security tokens have always been an interest to me as I've always liked the idea of using something physical to secure something that is digital. In todays climate it is very important to have some method of 2FA and this is one of the most secure ways of doing so. This project will allow me to explore everything that makes up physical security tokens. As well this will allow me to explore a solution for securing VM's with a physical token. 

### Objectives
------
The objective of this topic would be to create either a presentation, class, or research paper on physical security tokens. This will include but is not limited to:
* The protocols used in physical security tokens
* The functions behind physical security tokens
* The security risks/benifits of physical security tokens
* Using physical security tokens to secure virtual machines inside of VMware
* Possible ways to workaround a physical security token
As I conduct more research on the topic I will have a better idea of what this project will entail and will be adding more to this list in order to make it a more 
rigorous project. 

### Constraints
One of the only possible constaints I could see with this project is the price of hardware. However this should not be to much of worry.
