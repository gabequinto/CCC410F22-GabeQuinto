### Preselected Project
------
My second topic involves creating a golang program that functions as a triage kit as well as a CIS Security Benchmark compliance checker. This program will be able to ssh into a remote system, transfer either the triage or benchmark bash script, run that script, and exfil all of the relevant data back to the base machine. 

### Why? 
------
I have this chosen as my second project idea because I have never been great at programing and this seems like a good project to get me moving in the right direction. As for why I chose Golang, this was a recommendation by a professor at Champlain College. 

### Objectives
------
The objectives for this project are as follows:
* Create a go program that is able to ssh into remote machines
* transfer a file from base machine to remote machine
* run script on the remote machine
* transfer all relevant data back to base machine
* parse the data into a format that is very easy to read

### Constraints
------
The only constriant I can see as of now is simply my inexperience in programming.
