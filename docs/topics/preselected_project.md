### Preselected Project
------
My second topic idea is to complete one of the preselected topics that is offered by one of the professors at Champlain College. I have not selected a specific topic 
yet however one that I am interested in is building targets for Devin Padens Ethical Hacking classes. 

### Why? 
------
I have this chosen as my second project idea because I was having trouble coming up with what I would like to pursue as a capstone project. I am interested in building vulnerable targets for Ethical Hacking because Ethical Hacking 1 was one of my favorite classes I have taken at Champlain College and helping to build targets for it 
would help me gain more knowlege of ethical hacking techniques and vulnerabitlites as well as providing boxes for my colleges to practice on. 

### Objectives
------
The objectives of this project would be set forth by the professor I am doing this for. However if I do take on the project set forth by Devin, the objectives would be to:
* Research new vulnerabilites that are being discovered
* Build a vulnerable virtual machine that can be deployed on Cyber.Local for the ethical hacking 1 class
* Document all of my work so that the build is recreatable
* Any other objectives that Devin would give me

### Constraints
------
Again, any constraints would be set by the professor I am completing this project for.
