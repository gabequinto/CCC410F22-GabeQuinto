### Deliverable Statement and Objectives
---
For my capstone I am attempting to create a golang program that is able to do Linux triage and security compliance checking. For Design Project 1 I attempted to complete three objectives within this program which were the following:
* Creating an ssh session with a remote machine 
* Being able to execute commands on the remote machine
* Being able to scp files to the remote machine. 


One thing to note is that I had zero programming and more specifically golang knowledge going into this project so there was a lot of time spent learning the language in order to 
complete the objectives.
