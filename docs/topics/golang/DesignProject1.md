For this Design Project 1 assignment I have created 5 descrete tasks for myself that I will explain below. 

### Create a Go program to ssh into remote machines

For this task I will be creating the foundation of my program wich is being able to create an ssh session using GO. This is how I will be able to conduct triage or the CIS Compliance checker. 

## Modify go program to be able to execute commands on remote machine

Eventually within this program I will want to execute a bash script on the remote machine that I have an ssh session with. Because of this I have to create a way within the program to execute commands remotely. 

## SCP files between base and remote machine

This task diretly correlates with the task above. This will be the task that allows me to get the bash script onto the remote machine. As well, I will have to exfil the results of the bash script so I will need to be able to SCP that file from the remote machine back to the base machine.
