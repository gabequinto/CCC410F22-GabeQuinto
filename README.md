### Topic Selection

My two topic ideas will be linked below. The one that I am most interested in is creating a class, research paper, or presentation on physical security tokens. The second opiton that I have is to create a triage / security compliance checking program using golang in combination with bash scripts. This program will be able to ssh out to a remote machine, run the bash scripts, and than will be able to exfil all of the relevant data back to that base machine.
