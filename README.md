# CCC410F22-GabeQuinto

### Topic Selection

My two topic ideas will be linked below. The one that I am most interested in is creating a class, research paper, or presentation on physical security tokens. The second opiton that I have is to do one of the service projects that is provided by one of the professors at Champlain College. This will require a meeting with a professor to confirm that the project is still available and to get all of the requirments for the project.
